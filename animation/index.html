	<h1>Animation improvements</h1>

	<p>Below are my animation improvements. The recordings might not be able to capture them fully due to the frame rate
		and poor luck.</p>

	<article>
		<h2>1. Added red flash to the like button</h2>

		<p>Now the like button flashes when you like a message for additional feedback.</p>

		<video src="videos/v1.mp4" controls></video>
	</article>

	<article>
		<h2>2. Scale profile picture on hover</h2>

		<p>Now the profile pictures scale up when you hover over them for better visibility but also not taking up too
			much space initially.</p>

		<video src="videos/v2.mp4" controls></video>
	</article>

	<article>
		<h2>3. Scale edit input on appearance</h2>

		<p>Now the edit message controls render with a scaling animation when they are triggered for better feedback.
		</p>

		<video src="videos/v3.mp4" controls></video>
	</article>

	<article>
		<h2>4. Border flash on newly edited message</h2>

		<p>Now when a message is edited for the first time there's an animation which creates a temporary border around
			the message.</p>

		<video src="videos/v4.mp4" controls></video>
	</article>

	<article>
		<h2>5. Enabled buttons scale up and down</h2>

		<p>Now when a button becomes enabled it scales up and down for increased feedback such as when the user
			satisfies the requirement for changing the picture.</p>

		<video src="videos/v5.mp4" controls></video>
