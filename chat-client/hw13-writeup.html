    <h1>Final writeup</h1>

    <p>To recall, this app serves students working on group projects, and integrates tasks with chats in a way which
        exposes the members to the tasks before they can get to the chat screen.</p>

    <p>It consists of a main menu with channel and profile tabs, where the channels tab lets you subscribe to channels
        and navigate, and the profile tab lets you edit your information.</p>

    <p>Upon clicking a message you get to a description screen with the channel name, a chat button, and a tasks list.
        Users can add tasks, delete their own tasks, bump and complete any task.</p>

    <p>Finally, we have a similar chat menu as the previous assignments.</p>

    <p>Since the midpoint, we have made the following additions and changes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            We have implemented support for subscribing to channels (instead of hardcoded channel list that's lost every
            time). The subscriptions are sent to the 'subscriptions' channel as a message with a 'Subscription' type,
            and checked upon setup.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have implemented channels and profile tabs. The profile tab contains the controls for username change
            etc. This change was inspired by Prof. Karger's remarks during the studio that we do not need to have
            controls on all the time.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have decided against implementing the tasks tab. We believe that this requires keeping on with the
            contexts of all the saved channels at all times, which we felt was against the point of having contexts and
            switching between contexts in the first place.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have refactored likes into completions (and likes are now gone from messages). We have also made style
            changes to tasks for contrast (complete tasks are marked with line through). This also addresses the
            student/instructor feedback from user testing in studio that the app should allow other people to complete
            the tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have added editing support for tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have made significant style changes to how the messages are displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have implemented the bumping feature in two different places as consistent with the figma mockup.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have implemented accompanying chat messages with adding and removing tasks. This also addresses Prof.
            Karger's comments from the lecture that there should be a mechanism that ties the tasks to the chat (as well
            as the above change).
        </li>
        <li>
            We have improved visibility of system status by removing delete/edit buttons for non-owned tasks.
        </li>
    </ul>
