    <h1>Halfway writeup</h1>

    <p>What's coming:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Completing and editing tasks</li>
        <li>Task screen</li>
        <li>Subscribing to channels (instead of hardcoded channel list)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What's changed from the figma mockup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of hamburger menus maybe a list of buttons to replace edit menu</li>
        <li>Maybe not a pop up screen for in chat bumps</li>
        <li>No system messages? Unless it makes sense in some way</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What's arrived:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Channel list and 3-screen setup (main menu, description, chat)</li>
        <li>Adding channels</li>
        <li>Task list and adding tasks</li>
        <li>Visual structure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Based on what's arrived and what's coming, it is fair to say a good amount of work has been accomplished so far.</p>
