	<p>Here's a screenshot where I get the reads and the profile pictures.</p>

	<p>Here's a reference screenshot for the below three designs:</p>

	<article>
		<h2>Read receipts</h2>

		<p>Read receipts are very similar to the like objects, except that the read message is sent on
			<code>created()</code> instead of on a click. With every message, a list of usernames that read the message
			are displayed to everyone. See the reference screenshot for demonstration.
		</p>
	</article>

	<article>
		<h2>Replies</h2>

		<p>Replies get sent to the channel. To make this change, we set the context to the channel instead of the
			message id. We add the username and content from <code>inReplyTo</code> at the end of the header for the
			reply message. See the reference screenshot for demonstration.</p>
	</article>

	<article>
		<h2>Profile pictures</h2>

		<p>We added a section at the top like the one that changes the username to change the profile pictures. We made
			it editable similar to how name is editable. We used the functionality from the image upload to upload
			images and set them as profile pictures. For every message, we display the profile picture in the beginning
			of the header. If there is no profile picture, we display 'X'. If there is a profile picture but it can't be
			downloaded, we display 'Fail'. See the reference screenshot for demonstration.</p>
